# ANL201_ECA_JAN_2024_Semester

## Section A (100 marks)

Answer all questions in this section.

You are given a dataset pertaining to the tasks assigned for this ECA.

The name of the dataset is <Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data_usa.csv>. 

This dataset is posted with the ECA question paper on the Canvas system.

## Question 1 (20 marks)

For the given dataset, produce a table that identifies and justifies the data type (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) for each variable; the table should present the summary statistics (mean, median, number of observations, mode, minimum and maximum) for all the variables. 

Present the answer in tabular format.

## Question 3 (25 marks)

For the treated dataset, develop four charts to visualise and explain the key patterns found in the data. 

Use each of the following chart types or features at least once:
• Reference line
• Parameters

Provide screenshots of the charts in your report. 

### Chart 1: Stacked Bar Chart of the average electric range based on car maker and EV type

The individual average electric range of PHEV’s manufactured by KIA, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Ford are higher than the average electric range of 31.24. 

Chevrolet PHEV’s have the longest average electric range at 53, meanwhile, Volvo PHEV’s have the shortest at 25.80. 

Nissan BEV’s have the longest average electric range at 15.30, meanwhile, BMW BEV’s have the shortest at 1.52.

This mean that for each car maker, PHEV’s have a longer electric range compared to BEV’s. 

### Chart 2: Pie Charts of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility by city and EV type

In the 1st Pie Chart, Bellevue has the highest number of CAFV Eligible Electric Vehicles (EVs) at 363 while Renton has the lowest number at 216.

In the 2nd Pie Chart, Vancouver has the highest number of unknown CAFV Eligible EVs because of unknown battery range at 759 while Sammamish has the lowest number at 415.

In the 3rd Pie Chart, Bellevue has the highest number of ineligible CAFV EVs due to low battery range at 131 while the Bothell has the lowest number at 63.

### Chart 3: Tree Map of average electric range based on car model

The car maker Chevrolet offers the model VOLT that has the longest average electric range at 53 followed by the Volvo model V60 with 36 and the Ford model ESCAPE with 38.

The car maker BMW offers the model 745E that has the shortest average electric range at 16.

The model with the highest average electric range has the largest square while the model with the lowest average electric range has the smallest square. 

### Chart 4: Tree Map of the number of postal codes per legislative district

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/803d39c1-1df7-44fc-925f-2460d486b0ca)

The district with the highest postal codes number has the largest square while the district with the lowest number had the smallest square.

By filtering for the number of postal codes between 502 and 1332, all districts are located in WA and district 48 has the largest postal code number at 1332. 

Meanwhile, district 17 has the lowest number with 502.
