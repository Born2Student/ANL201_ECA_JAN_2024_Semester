Answer all questions in this section.

You are given a dataset pertaining to the tasks assigned for this ECA.

The name of the dataset is <Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data_usa.csv>. 

This dataset is posted with the ECA question paper on the Canvas system.

## Question 1 (20 marks)

For the given dataset, produce a table that identifies and justifies the data type (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) for each variable; the table should present the summary statistics (mean, median, number of observations, mode, minimum and maximum) for all the variables. 

Present the answer in tabular format.

## Question 3 (25 marks)

For the treated dataset, develop four charts to visualise and explain the key patterns found in the data. 

Use each of the following chart types or features at least once:
• Reference line
• Parameters

Provide screenshots of the charts in your report. 

### Chart 1: Stacked Bar Chart of the average electric range based on car maker and EV type

The individual average electric range of PHEV’s manufactured by KIA, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Ford are higher than the average electric range of 31.24. 

Chevrolet PHEV’s have the longest average electric range at 53, meanwhile, Volvo PHEV’s have the shortest at 25.80. 

Nissan BEV’s have the longest average electric range at 15.30, meanwhile, BMW BEV’s have the shortest at 1.52.

This mean that for each car maker, PHEV’s have a longer electric range compared to BEV’s. 

### Chart 2: Pie Charts of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility by city and EV type

In the 1st Pie Chart, Bellevue has the highest number of CAFV Eligible Electric Vehicles (EVs) at 363 while Renton has the lowest number at 216.

In the 2nd Pie Chart, Vancouver has the highest number of unknown CAFV Eligible EVs because of unknown battery range at 759 while Sammamish has the lowest number at 415.

In the 3rd Pie Chart, Bellevue has the highest number of ineligible CAFV EVs due to low battery range at 131 while the Bothell has the lowest number at 63.
